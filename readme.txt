This is a simple plugin that interacts with the WordPress database and creates a table to hold information about local breweries and home brew supply stores.

== Description ==
The OBG Brewery Data plugin was developed for the [Oregon Beer Guy](http://theoregonbeerguy.com) blog. When activated, it creates two tables in the WordPress database. One is 
intended to contain the location and contact information for local breweries, the other is information about home brewing supply shops. The plug in does not populate the table 
data. At this time the data must be populated directly into the database via MySQL queries. Future implimentation will introduce an administrative panel to allow for data manipulation.
